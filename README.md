# DummyApi

This is a personal repository where I will be creating 'dummy' Apis that I will be calling in future personal projects.

### Goal:

I am trying to sharpen my Javascrirpt skills by developping applications using different Javascript Frameworks and libraries. These dummy apis will serve as a resources for those applications.
